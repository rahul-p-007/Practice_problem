The code initializes an unordered_map called mapping to store the cumulative sum of elements encountered so far as keys and their corresponding indices as values.

The code initializes ans and sum to zero.

The code sets the value of mapping[0] to -1 to handle the case when the subarray with sum zero starts from the first index.

The code iterates over the input array A using a for loop.
Inside the for loop, the code updates the sum variable as the cumulative sum of elements encountered so far.

The code checks if the sum value is already present as a key in the mapping unordered_map using mapping.find(sum) != mapping.end(). If the sum value is found, it means that there is a subarray with sum zero that ends at the current index i.

If sum is found in mapping, the code calculates the length of this subarray by subtracting the value of mapping[sum] from the current index i, and takes the maximum of this length and ans.

If sum is not found in mapping, it means that there is no subarray with sum zero that ends at the current index, and the current index i and its corresponding sum sum are added to mapping.

After the for loop finishes, the code returns the ans value, which represents the length of the maximum length subarray with sum zero in the input array A.
