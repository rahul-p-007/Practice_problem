## Input:
S = i.like.this.program.very.much

Output: much.very.program.this.like.i

Explanation: After reversing the whole
string(not individual words), the input
string becomes
much.very.program.this.like.i

## Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Declare a string ans to store the reversed string.

string ans;

Iterate over the string s in reverse order using a for loop with loop variable i initialized to s.size() - 1 and decremented in each iteration.


    for(int i=s.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {

Check if the character at index i is a dot ('.'). If it is, extract the word between the current dot and the next dot (or end of string) by iterating over the characters of s from i+1 to the next dot (or end of string) and appending each character to the string ans. Finally, append a dot to ans to separate the words.


    if(s[i] == '.') {
        int j=i+1;
        while(j < s.size() && s[j]!='.') {
            ans.push_back(s[j]);
            j++;
        }
        ans.push_back('.');
    }
After the loop, extract the first word in s by iterating over the characters of s from the beginning until the first dot (or end of string) and appending each character to ans.


    int i=0;
    while(i < s.size() && s[i]!='.') {
    ans.push_back(s[i]);
    i++;
    }

Finally, return the reversed string ans.


return ans;
This implementation correctly reverses the words in a given string separated by a dot.



**Suppose the input string is i.like.this.program.very.much. Here's how the code will execute:**

Initialize an empty string ans.


string ans;

Iterate over the string s in reverse order using a for loop. In the first iteration, i will be initialized to the index of the last character in s ('h').


    for(int i=s.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {

In the first iteration, the loop will encounter the dot ('.') after the word 'much'. The if condition will be satisfied and the block of code inside it will be executed.


    if(s[i] == '.') {
        int j=i+1;
        while(j < s.size() && s[j]!='.') {
            ans.push_back(s[j]);
            j++;
        }
        ans.push_back('.');
    }

The variable j will be initialized to i+1, which is the index of the first character after the dot. The while loop will iterate over the characters of s from index j to the next dot (or end of string) and append each character to the string ans. In this case, it will append the word 'much' to ans. Finally, it will append a dot to ans to separate the words. So, at the end of the first iteration, ans will be 'much.'.

In the second iteration, i will be initialized to the index of the second last character in s ('y').


    for(int i=s.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {

In the second iteration, the loop will encounter the dot ('.') after the word 'very'. The if condition will be satisfied and the block of code inside it will be executed.

    if(s[i] == '.') {
        int j=i+1;
        while(j < s.size() && s[j]!='.') {
            ans.push_back(s[j]);
            j++;
        }
        ans.push_back('.');
    }

The variable j will be initialized to i+1, which is the index of the first character after the dot. The while loop will iterate over the characters of s from index j to the next dot (or end of string) and append each character to the string ans. In this case, it will append the word 'very' to ans. Finally, it will append a dot to ans to separate the words. So, at the end of the second iteration, ans will be 'much.very.'.

In the third iteration, i will be initialized to the index of the third last character in s ('m').

    for(int i=s.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {
In the third iteration, the loop will encounter the dot ('.') after the word 'program'. The if condition will be satisfied and the block of code inside it will be executed.

    if(s[i] == '.') {
        int j=i+1;
        while(j < s.size() && s[j]!='.') {
            ans.push_back(s[j]);
            j++;
        }
        ans.push_back('.');
    }

The variable j will be initialized to i+1, which is the index of the first character after the dot. The `

    int i=0;
    while(i < s.size() && s[i]!='.') {
    ans.push_back(s[i]);
    i++;
}

This block of code is used to handle the last word in the input string that does not have a trailing dot. It iterates over the characters of s starting from the first character (index 0) and appends each character to the string ans until it encounters a dot or reaches the end of the string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this block of code works:

Initialize i to 0.


    int i = 0;

Use a while loop to iterate over the characters of s from the first character (index 0) to the next dot (or end of string). In each iteration, check if the current character is a dot. If it is not a dot, append it to the string ans.


    while(i < s.size() && s[i]!='.') {
    ans.push_back(s[i]);
    i++;
}

At the end of the loop, ans will contain the last word in the input string without a trailing dot.

    For example, if the input string is "i.like.this.program", this block of code will append the word "program" to ans. At the end of the loop, ans will contain "much.very.program", which is the reversed string with each word reversed and separated by dots.
